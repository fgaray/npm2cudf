\section{NPM package repository}

The NPM (Node Package Manager) is the de factor package manager for the nodejs
ecosystem. Users use a centralized server called registry where all the public
packages' metadata is stored using a CouchDB database. A public replica of this
database can be found in \url{https://skimdb.npmjs.com/}.

Since CouchDB allows easy replication, we can ask a local database to replicate
the registry of NPM and even to use a continous replication, that means that
every time there is a change in the master database, the replica will be update
with them.

This replication can be accomplish using the interface of CouchDB, pointing the
source to \url{https://skimdb.npmjs.com/} and the destination to ``registry''.

Notice that there is a entry in the database that prevents the replication of
more packages once is copied to the local database. This document can be
identified by the id ``\_design/app'' and it is sufficient to delete it and
resume the replication.

At the moment of the writing of this document the database has a size of 1.3 GB
with 233593	unique documents/packages.
